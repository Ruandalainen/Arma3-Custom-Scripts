# CallArtilleryWithSpotObject
Originally I found this script from White Raven's Youtube channel. Here is the video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=LmuC0ur1NyY

## Things I changed to work with my setup
* _trg = getPosATL latestSpot;
* variable names to be _artillery (1, 2, 3...) from _mortar, though I would use _mortar too if the support unit would be mortar instead of SPG or MLRS
