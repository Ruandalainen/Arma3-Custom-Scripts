# Arma3 Custom Scripts
This repository was made to host my custom scripts for making scenarios in Arma 3

## Scripts Included
Most of the scripts here are made to work with some mods and only in my own scenarios, though they are most likely going to work fine with other machines and scenarios. Some of the scripts may be mashup of different examples on Reddit or Youtube to be usable to my needs (if they are straight up copies I will include the name of the original creator and where they shared their work).


## How The Scripts Are Made:

**Software used:** Visual Studio Code with SQF language addon.

**Language used:** SQF (Status Quo Function).

**Editor mod used:** 3den enchanced.
